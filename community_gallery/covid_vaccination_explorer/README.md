## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Preswald framework

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/covid-vaccination-explorer.git

   ```

2. Install Preswald if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install preswald
   ```

3. Download the dataset:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p data
   curl -o data/covid_vaccinations.csv https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/public/data/vaccinations/vaccinations.csv
   ```

4. Make sure your `preswald.toml` file is set up with the correct data source:
   ```toml
   [data.covid_vaccinations]
   type = "csv"
   path = "data/covid_vaccinations.csv"
   ```

### Running the App

Run the application locally with:

```bash
preswald run hello.py
```

This will start the Preswald server and open the application in your default web browser (typically at http://localhost:8501).

## üåê Deployment

1. Google Cloud Run:
   ```bash
   preswald deploy hello.py --target gcp
   ```

2. Structured Cloud (Preswald's managed service):
   ```bash
   preswald deploy hello.py --target structured
   ```

## üìù Usage Guide

1. **Global Map**: The main map shows worldwide vaccination rates. Select different metrics using the dropdown above the map.

2. **Country Selection**: Click on a country in the map or use the dropdown to select a specific country for detailed analysis.

3. **Time Range**: Use the time period selector to view data over different time spans.

4. **Comparative Analysis**: The vaccination leaders section shows countries with the highest vaccination rates.

5. **Population Analysis**: The scatter plot at the bottom compares vaccination rates with population sizes.
